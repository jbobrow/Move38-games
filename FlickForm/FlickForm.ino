/*  Flick Form / Chimera (Game)
 *  
 *  Inspired by chemical bonds, this game rewards players for flicking their tiles into difficult to attach configurations
 *  
 *  2 center tiles are attached to share one side. They wait pulsing white together
 *  (if these 2 tiles are alone, they are simply flashing white)
 *  
 *  Each player gets 2 tiles (team cyan and team magenta)
 *  
 *  Player 1 flicks each tile first attaching one, to make the mass 3 tiles
 *  then flicks the second to make the mass 4 tiles
 *  
 *  When a tile attaches, all 3... or all 4 tiles flash n times, according to the score of the placement of the tile
 *  
 *  Player 2 does the same
